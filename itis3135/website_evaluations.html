                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Amazon is a major technology company that mainly focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, 
                and artificial intelligence. It is one of the most valuable companies in the world.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>C: Contrast</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        From first glance, Amazon is a colorful site with several products being displayed on the home page. The contrast 
                        on some products could be better as they are too vibrant, but the nav bar and overall theme of the website are great.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>R: Repitition</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Amazon repeats several elements of its website and is easy to navigate. Everything you need to find is mostly on the home page.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>A: Alignment</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The alignment on the website is good, there is nothing misaligned and everything looks correct.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>P: Proximity</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The proximity on the webpage is good, there is little to no empty space, and the entire page is filled quite nicely.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Google is a technology company that is widely known for its search engine, advertsing, computer software, and electronics.
                Google is one of the most valuable brands in the world.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>C: Contrast</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The contrast of the website is alright. The white background is a little strong, but it goes well with the rest of the theme. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>R: Repitition</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        Repetition is fairly simple and is done well. There is not much to the website, so everything is easy to navigate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>A: Alignment</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The alignment of the page is good. There are not too many elements so there is a good amount of empty space, but everything is aligned correctly.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>P: Proximity</strong></h4>
                    <p>
                        The proximity on the webpage is alright. There is a lot of empty space, but the website itself is meant to be simple.
                    </p>
                </li>
