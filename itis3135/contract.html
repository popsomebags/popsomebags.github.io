        <h2>Contract</h2>

        <p>
            I, William Zhang, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022, ITIS3135, Web App Design and Development, with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br><br>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmatesâ€™ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.<br><br><br>
            
            Signed: <em>William Zhang, 09/12/2022</em>
